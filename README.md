# W3C Web Audio Community Group

This is the repository for the [W3C Audio Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/audio-comgp/).

The Audio Community Group is to gather and incubate new features for the better
audio functionality on web. It is also to make it easier for the community to
engage with the [Audio Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2011/audio/).

> Note: Community Groups are proposed and run by the community. Although W3C
hosts these conversations, the groups do not necessarily represent the views of
the W3C Membership or staff.

properties that have been completely hidden or unavailable to developers.
